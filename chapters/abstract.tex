\section*{Abstract}

As 5G is a relatively new technology that is gaining relevance, the threat of \textit{distributed denial-of-service} (DDoS) is an important problem.

To explore the effects of DDoS attacks, this project shows an implementation and validation of DDoS attacks in a simulated 5G network, using the simulation framework ns-3 with 5G-Lena. Further the implications and benefits network slicing has in this context are demonstrated. 
Using the tracing system provided by ns-3, a custom tracing implementation and NetAnim, data was gathered that show the dropping bandwidth during DDoS attacks and the successful separation of the slices, so that only the slices where attacks are present suffer from its effects.

The chosen implementation style though could not be used to dynamically isolate the attacker on a slice. Conclusions were drawn to help guide future implementations.
